The majority of the employee have high performance score and meet the expectations which suggests most of the employee are doing well and producing good work. There are small numbers of employee in PIP and Needs Improvemnet groups. Together they make up less than 10% of the population.

The higher number of employee are neutral at the middle or 3 out 5 on their satisfaction rating. It shows that majority of the people are not completly unhappy with thier works or the company or company policies. There are 2 employee who gave 1 rating and 9 people with 2 ratings. It shows that there are employee who have very lower satisfaction level.

Although, there are good number of employee, 98, who are completely satisfy with thier workload and company policies and more. Overall, Strong majority are content or happy at work.

The Engagement survey histagram is left skewed which mean that mean is less than the median. More values are on the right sides which suggests that more employees have high engagement in the company. Most employees gave a 5 on engagement which can suggest that company's culture, leadership and policies align with the employee's interests. More than 50 employee are are highly engaged in the company which shows that company promote different engagement events and parties are held at the company. 

The highest number of absences is 15.0 days which is very high which can profound impect on the productivity. High absences suggests that there most likely have lower work effectiveness due to it. These absences can mean that company is lenient with absenses therefore it is so high and it also means that compnay do not enforce any kind of penelty of absences.

There are none high or slightly high lateness in the last 30 days which is surprissing due to the fact they are very high absences but none lateness. The highestest number of days of lateness is 4 where only 8 people came in late for the last month. It suggests that they are effective late polices exists in the compmay therefore 278 employees didn't came in late even once in the last 30 days. 

There are only 21 employees out of 300 employee are on 5 to 6 special projects which is a low number. Some selective employees are prioritizing and their chances of higher growth at the company can be determined by that.

There are 104 employee out of 311 has been terminated before which is a large number to consider. One‑third of the people in this company have experienced a termination event. This also can be due to higher absences.

Higher performing employees does take moderate amount such as 10–12 days on average of absenses maybe be due to they better vacation time-off or sick‑time.

### How do PerformanceScore ratings vary among different races of people, marital status, gender, and citizenship status?

The Bar graph shows that the race that have higher performance is the white people followed by Black then Asian. It can be due to White people having more oppurtunities to growth in the company. There is an clear lack of diversity in the company since majority of the employee are White.

Female employees Perform better than Male Employees. Women have a higher rate of Fully Meets performance and a lower rate of PIP/Needs Improvement compare to men. There are also more female employees can male and these female employees are performing pretty good.

Single employee perform better than other groups of marital status which mightly due to they are less occupied with family life and focus more on work.

Married employee come next in line which might be due to they push themselves more so they can provide for their family. Higher pressure and more responsibilites.

Divorced, widowed and separated employees perform very low compare to single and married employed maybe due to the fact that they have more personal issues they have to focus on which lower their focus from work.

Employees with citizenship status perform better than non-citizen employees and there are higher number of Employees with citizenship status. This might be due to that they have more oppurunitites for growth and provided with better facilities such as salary.
